# MaiChaiMouseButMe

Analyze and visualize gaming mouse specs using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

## Project Overview
MaiChaiMouseButMe is a web app for exploring, searching, and analyzing gaming mouse data. It uses PCA to help you find the best mouse for your needs, compare models, and understand feature importance. Built for the course 01076032 Elementary Differential Equations and Linear Algebra.

## Features
- Search and view mouse specs from a curated dataset
- Add new mouse models to your collection
- See detailed mouse info in a modal popup
- Select features for PCA analysis
- Visualize PCA results and recommendations
- Step-by-step PCA math explanation
- Interactive Plotly graphs
